# When designing my unit tests, I focused on two main considerations. First, I tested the expected, normal behavior of the function by checking that it returns the correct greeting when a name is provided. Second, I included a test for an empty string case to confirm the function handles missing input gracefully instead of breaking or returning incorrect output.
